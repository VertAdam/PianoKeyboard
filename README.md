# PianoKeyboard
Use your digital piano as your computer keyboard!
Simply plug in your digital piano (must have a midi output) to your computer and start typing, or whatever you call it when its on a Piano.

## Setup
This is built on the back off the python package mido which utilizes rtmidi for the port setup.

I am currently using Python 3.9 on windows and have not tested if a different version/Operating systems will cause any problems.

To get this going
1. plug in your MIDI Device
2. Download this package
3. Run the PianoFun class and select your input/output ports
4. activate the PianoKeyboard method

In code, it will look something like this:
